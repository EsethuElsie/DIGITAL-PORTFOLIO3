# 💬 Business Communication – STAR Reflection

### ⭐ **Situation**
When I first joined Masebo Networks I was given a task to create a survey for companies that might be interested in doing WIL internships.

### 🎯 **Task**
My task was to find out if there are companies interested on WIL and finding out their struggles with not implementing or even feedback from the ones that already did. It was also my responsibility to make sure that my daily reports reflected accurate project updates so that my supervisor and the rest of the team could make informed decisions.

### 🛠️ **Action**

To address this, I introduced a survey internally first before putting in on LinkedIn and any available platforms. By maintaining open communication lines, I ensured that information flowed efficiently.
### 🎉 **Result**
I received positive feedback for my tone and structure, and I learned how important clarity and professionalism are in business communication. This improved my confidence in writing formal emails and responding professionally in workplace scenarios.The implementation of these strategies significantly reduced miscommunication and improved overall productivity. My supervisor commended my initiative and attention to detail in streamlining project updates. Through this experience, I learned that effective business communication is about being proactive, organized, and clear — qualities that I will continue to apply in future professional settings.
